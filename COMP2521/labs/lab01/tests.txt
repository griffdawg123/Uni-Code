Observations:
> Clearly, the more numbers needed to sort, the longer the system will take to sort
> Reverse order is by far the fastest method on all accounts. This is due to each number encounted to sort will be the shortest in the list. 
    This means that the algorithm doesn't need to iterate through the full list and thus will be quicker than either of the other data lists
> randomly ordered data lists take the longest time, *not sure why*
> The in built sorting function is extremely quick showing my algorithm is unoptimised.
